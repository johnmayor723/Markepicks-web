    <p>Thanks for shopping with Market Picks! We want you to be happy with your purchases, so we offer refunds for both perishable and non-perishable items within six (6) hours of delivery.

    <h2 style="color: #2D7B30;">Guidelines for Refund</h2>
    <p>If we are unable to provide a food item you ordered at the requested time and your order is less than ₦5,000, we will refund the amount to your Market Picks wallet. You can use this refund to buy other items immediately or later. For orders above ₦5,000, refunds can go to your Market Picks wallet or your bank account, whichever you prefer. If the food item delivered is inadequate, the refund will be issued to your Market Picks wallet only.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> All returns and refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the availability of the item, logistics, and reasonable grounds.</p>
